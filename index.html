            <p>Zombies have taken over planet Earth and all humans must evacuate within 4 days. There are a few planets that humans can lie on but X0-0516 is the best. This planet has water, an atmosphere and has successfully housed humans in the past. We will be lauching 12 rocketships to this planet and you can choose what one you want to fly in. Each ship has their parks and flaws so make sure you choose wisely. Also make sure to take the quiz about mission evacuate, this will make sure you are ready to live on another planet. If you get a question wrong, you better make sure you get it right next time. This is because we cant afford to make mistakes, otherwise the whole human race is put under threat.</p>
